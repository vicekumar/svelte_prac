** This project is to track my work creating a simple svelte app which interfaces with a python-django backend **

Dont forget to set the following postgres variables in your development environment:

PG_USER: Postgres user the django app will use to interact with psql
PG_PASS: password for the postgres user
PG_HOST: host machine where our postgres instance is hosted (default: localhost)
PG_PORT: port where postgres can be found on the host machine (default: 5432)
